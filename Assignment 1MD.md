## Task 1:

1. Install Jupyter notebook and run the first program and share the screenshot of the output


```python
1+2
```




    3



2. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a  multipleof 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.


```python
list = []
for i in range(2000,3200):
    if i%7==0 :
        if i%5!=0:
            list.append(i)
# print(list)
s = [str(i) for i in list] 
print(",".join(s))
```

3. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them      printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.



```python
# print("Enter your first name")
firstname = input("Enter your first name")
lastname = input("enter your last name")
print(firstname[::-1] + " " + lastname[::-1])

```

    Enter your first nameshirisha
    enter your last nameraghunath

4. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
   Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r3


```python
r=12
pi = 3.1415926535897931
v = 4/3 * pi* r**3
print(v)
```

# Task 2:
1. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
   generate a list.



```python
values = input("enter comma seperated values")
list = values.split(",")

print('List : ',list)
```

    enter comma seperated values1,2,3,4,5,6
    List :  ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']
    

2. Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python.



```python
for i in range(0,5):
    for j in range(0,i+1):
        print("* ",end="") #end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
    print("\r")  
for i in range(5,0,-1):
    for j in range(0,i+1):
        print("* ",end="") #end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
    print("\r")      
```

3. Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user.
   Sample Output:
   Input word: AcadGild
   Output: dilGdacA


```python
s = input("enter your word ")
def reverse_slicing(s):
    return s[::-1]
print(reverse_slicing(s))

```

    enter your word shirisha
    ahsirihs
    


```python
s = input("enter your word")
s[::-1]
```

    enter your wordshirisha
